"""
Support for deferred evaluation; typical usecase is, you want to write something like::

    somevar=$(ssh nodename some-command)
    ssh othernode other-command $somevar

but because a Schduler is totally created before it gets to run anything, creating a
``Run()`` instance from a string means that the string must be known at sheduler-creation
time, at which point we do not yet have the value of somevar

that's where ``Deferred`` objects come in; they fill in for actual ``str`` objects, but
are actually templates that are rendered later on when the command is actually about to
trigger

typically in a kubernetes-backed scenario, we often need to get a pod's name by issuing an
ssh command to the master node, so this is not a static data that can be filled in the
code

class Variables(dict):
    """
    think of this class as a regular namespace, i.e. a set of associations variable â†’
    value

    we cannot use the regular Python, binding because at the time where a Scheduler gets
    built, those variables are not yet available

    so the ``Variables`` object typically collects values that are computed during a
    scheduler run

    just like a JS object, a ``Variables`` object can be accessed through indexing or
    attributes all the same,

    so that::

        variables = Variables()
        variables.foo = 'bar'
        variables['bar'] = 'foo'
        variables.foo == variables['foo']  # True
        variables.var == variables['bar']  # True

    it is common to create a single ``Variables`` environment for a ``Scheduler`` run;
    variables inside the environment are often set by creating ``Run``-like objects with a
    ``Capture`` instance that specifies in what variable the result should end up

class Deferred:
    """
    the ``Deferred`` class is the trick that lets you introduce what we call
    deferred evaluation in a scenario; main use case being when you run a remote
    command to compute something, that in turn is used later on by another
    Run or Service object; except that, because the scheduler and its jobs/commands
    pieces are created before it gets run, you cannot compute all the details right away,
    you need to have some parts replaces later on - that is, deferred

    Parameters:
      template(str): a Jinja template as a string, that may contain variables
        or expressions enclosed in ``{{}}``
      variables(Variables): an environment object that will collect values over time,
        so that variables in ``{{}}`` can be expansed when the time comes

    a ``Deferred`` object can be used to create instances
    of the ``Run`` class and its siblings, or of the ``Service`` class;
    this is useful when the command contains a part
    that needs to be computed during the scenario

    .. warning:: **beware of f-strings !**

       since Jinja templates use double brackets
       as delimiters for expressions, it is probably unwise to create a template
       from an f-string, or if you do you will have to insert variable inside
       quadruple brackets like so `{{{{varname}}}}`, so that after f-string evaluation
       a double bracket remains.
