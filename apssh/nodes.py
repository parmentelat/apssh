# ========== SshNode == SshProxy

# use apssh's sshproxy mostly as-is, except for keys handling
# the thing is, this implementation relies on formatters
# which probably needs more work.
# in particular this works fine only with remote processes
# whose output is text-based but well,
# right now I'm in a rush and would want to see stuff running...

# it's mostly a matter of exposing a more meaningful name in this context
# might need a dedicated formatter at some point


class SshNode(SshProxy):
    """
    An instance of `SshNode` typically is needed to create a
    :class:`apssh.sshjob.SshJob` instance, that defines a batch of commands
    or file transfers to run in sequence on that node.

    Examples:
      A typical usage to create a job that runs 2 commands remotely::

        remote_node = SshNode('remote.foo.com', username='tutu')

        SshJob(node=remote_node,
               commands = [

                   Run("sleep 10"),
               ])

    This class is a very close specialization of the
    :class:`~apssh.sshproxy.SshProxy` class.
    The only difference are in the handling of default values
    at build time.

    Parameters:
      hostname: remote node's hostname
      username: defaults to ``root`` if unspecified, note that
        :class:`~apssh.sshproxy.SshProxy`'s default is to use
        the local username instead
      keys: filenames for the private keys to use when authenticating;
        the default policy implemented in this class is to first use the
        keys currently loaded in the ssh agent. If none can be found this
        way, `SshNode` will attempt to import the default ssh keys located
        in ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` and ``~/.ssh/id_dsa``.
