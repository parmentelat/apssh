    "The purpose is to come up with an as-simple-as-it-gets replacement for our toolset for orchestrating network experiments. In its simplest form, it can be described as an ***orchestration tool for `asyncio`-based libraries***, with the following objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* we ***primarily*** target ***ssh-based*** kind of interactions with nodes; typically we need to control any number of nodes reachable through ssh, ranging from hundreds of them in the context of PlanetLab, down to tens or a handful in the context of R2lab\n",
    "* previous tools like in particular [NEPI](http://nepi.inria.fr) came with a very ambitious goal of being extremely generic, to the cost of achieving poor to very poor performance, in particular in the specific niche of ssh-addressable nodes; in contrast, here we want to achieve optimal performance, to the possible cost of generality.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in order to take these objectives into account:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we want to have full control on ssh connections, and specifically to open only one such connection per node for the whole duration of the exp.\n",
    "* `asyncio` allows us to be totally single-threaded, so no multi-threading is needed, and thus no critical section nonsense\n",
    "* similarly we want to be able to rely on the internal ssh protocol to be notified when a remote command is done, ***instead of having to cyclically*** check for its status, which comes at an incredibly high cost\n",
    "\n",
    "It appears that the only critical feature required here as compared to what `asyncio` offers out of the box, is to handle dependencies between atomic jobs. It the main and only purpose of this micro-tool, to allow an experimenter to describe its experiment as a logically ordered set of jobs. "

Virtually everything is available as `asyncio`-compliant these days, from `http` to `telnet` - already used e.g. in `rhubarbe` - to, I am sure, `xmlrpc` or other more modern variants based on JSON, as well as XMPP-based stuff, if need be.
